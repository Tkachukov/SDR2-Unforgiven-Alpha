How to install the mod:

This mod requires the English PC version of the Super Danganronpa 2 and relies
on the Danganronpa Another Tool for installation.

0. Download the "data" folder from above.

1. Download Danganronpa Another Tool (which I would call DRAT later):
   https://github.com/Liquid-S/Danganronpa-Another-Tool/releases/tag/v1.5.2 

2. Open your SDR2's root folder and find the dr2_data.wad file here. 

3. Make a backup copy of this file and put it somewhere you'd remember.

4. Run DRAT and extract the dr2_data.wad file with it.
   (Do not forget to switch to "DR2 (PC)" option above!) 

5. Open the DR2 (PC) [MANUAL MODE] > EXTRACTED > WAD > dr2_data folder from inside
   your DRAT root folder.

6. Copy the "data" folder you had downloaded inside
   the "Dr2" folder which should be located inside "dr2_data". Choose "Replace all" for files "with the same name". 

7. Now run DRAT again and press "Repack WAD". Wait until the new WAD file is repacked.

8. Open the DR2 (PC) [MANUAL MODE] > REPACKED > WAD folder from inside
   your DRAT root folder, copy the dr2_data.wad file from there an replace with it 
   the dr2_data.wad file located in your SDR2 root folder. You did it!

9. To uninstall the mod, replace the changed dr2_data.wad file with the backup copy you had made on step 3.
